The following are some potential features that are being considered as enhancements to this starter. Please consider [sponsoring](https://github.com/sponsors/hellotham) us if these features are important to you and you would like them to be implemented sooner. Alternately, if you want to implement any of these features, please let us know and we will be happy to support you!

- full support for authors (with author profiles and avatars)
- photo gallery support using PhotoSwipe
- Support for diagrams eg. mermaidjs, plantuml, etc.

Current issues:

- Img component doesn't work in prod due to @astrojs/image not respecting base in output, hopefully this will be fixed soon. [#4436](https://github.com/withastro/astro/issues/4436)
- MDX content currently not included in search as it does not support rawContent property.
