# hello-astro

Test repository for playing around with [Astro](https://astro.build).

Uses the following integrations:

- @astrojs/image
- @astrojs/sitemap
- @astrojs/rss
- @astrojs/tailwind
- astro-icon
- astro-seo

In addition, SVG and PNG illustrations sourced from [Undraw](https://undraw.co)

Contains a bare bones port of [hello-gatsby-starter](https://github.com/hellotham/hello-gatsby-starter)

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ favicon.ico
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ header.astro
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ images/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ image.png
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ base.astro
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ pages/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ index.astro
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ blog/
â”‚   â”‚       â””â”€â”€ 2022-08-01-post.md
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ svg/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ image.svg
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ config.ts
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro`, `.md` or `.mdx` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components or layouts.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
